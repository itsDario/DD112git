		<h1>Game of Thrones</h1>
		
		
		<h2 class="one">Plot</h2>
		<p>The series closely follows the multiple storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire series,[5] and George R. R. Martin said that the show's pilot script was very faithful to his work.[6] Set in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Game of Thrones chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the kingdom's noble families for control of the Iron Throne; as the series opens, additional threats from the snow and ice covered region north of Westeros and from the eastern continent, Essos, across a narrow sea are simultaneously beginning to rise.</p>

		<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>The series began development in January 2007.[7] HBO, after acquiring the rights to the novels with the intent of turning them into an international cable television series, hired David Benioff and D. B. Weiss to write and executive produce the series, which would cover one novel's worth of material per season.[7] Initially, it was planned that Benioff and Weiss would write every episode save one per season, which author and co-executive producer George R. R. Martin was attached to write.[7][8] However, Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to each write one episode of the first season.</p>
				<p>The show's costumes are inspired by many cultures, such as Japanese and Persian. Dothraki outfits resemble that of the Bedouins (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear fur side in and skin side out like the Inuit.[29] Wildling bone armor is made of molds taken of real bones and assembled with string and latex resembling catgut.[30] While extras who portray Wildlings and the Night's Watch wear hats as would be normal in a cold climate, main actors usually do not so viewers can identify the characters. Bj√∂rk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Dormer's unusual funnel-neck outfit, and prostitute costumes are designed to be quickly removed.[29] All clothing, whether for Wildlings or for women at the royal court, is aged for two weeks to improve realism on high-definition television.</p>

		<h2>Broadcast</h2>
		
		<p>The first season of Game of Thrones premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011,[33] and the second season on April 1, 2012. On the same day or in the subsequent weeks or months, the show also began airing in several other countries. The series is available only through HBO or its affiliates, not through third-party video on demand services, and in many countries not at all. This has contributed to the series being widely pirated.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Reception</h2>
		
			<h3>What was the Cultural Impact?</h3>
			<p>Game of Thrones has been credited with an increased popularity of fantasy themes and mainstream acceptance of the fantasy fandom. "After this weekend", CNN.com wrote on the eve of the second season's premiere, "you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy". According to Ian Bogost, Game of Thrones continues a trend of successful screen adaptations, beginning with Peter Jackson's 2001 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and continuing with the Harry Potter films, that have established fantasy as a lucrative mass market genre and serve as "gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture".</p>
			
			<h3>What was the Critical Response?</h3>
			<p>The majority of reviews for the first season were very positive, with critics noting the high production values, the well-realized world, compelling characters, and giving particular note to the strength of the child actors.[56][57] As of March 7, 2012, the first season of Game of Thrones has a Metacritic average of 79 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews, categorized as "generally favorable".[58] The series was listed on many "best of 2011" lists published by U.S. media, including that of the Washington Post and TIME.[59][60][61] Variety wrote that "there may be no show more profitable to its network than 'Game of Thrones' is to HBO. Fully produced by the pay cabler and already a global phenomenon after only one season, the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely."</p>
		
			<h3>What were the Ratings?</h3>
			<p>By the end of May 2012, after the penultimate episode of the second season, Game of Thrones had accumulated an average of 10.3 million viewers per episode, including all repeats and on-demand viewings. This made it the third most-watched series in the history of HBO.[71] According to the tracking site TorrentFreak, the show averaged 3.9 million downloads per episode through public BitTorrent trackers for the 2012 season.[72] In response, Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, criticized HBO for not making its shows immediately available through online services such as Netflix and iTunes and requiring a cable television subscription to access its own HBO Go service.</p>

			<h3>What Awards did they receive?</h3>
			<p>The first season of Game of Thrones was nominated for thirteen of the 2011 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series. It won two, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Main Title Design. Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister, was named best supporting actor by the Emmys, the Golden Globes, the Scream Awards and the Satellite Awards.</p>
