		<h2>Reflection: The Beginning</h2>
		<p>I'd say my strongest skill that I will bring to web design class is  an understanding of code</p>
		<p>and reading comprehension skills. My weakest skill is my writing speed and quality </p>
		<p> I think This class will help me improve my web-development skills</p>

		<h3>Persona:</h3>
		<p>My persona's name is <b>Pigeon Man</b>. He was born a raised in New York and Delivers Mail around the city.</p>
		<blockquote><address>
		<p>I love delivering mail because it lets me fly around a visit many locations around the city</p>
		<p>my work involves carrying Mail around to each building every morning on time. In my life i have</p>
		<p>overcame people judging me based on what i look like and the fact that I can fly. For the future</p>
